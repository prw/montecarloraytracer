This is a simple c++ raytracer, ideally using montecarlo raytracing to compare to radiosity rendering methods.

Written on linux with g++, should work on other platforms.

Adjust CFLAGS and CXX according to your platform and needs, then just make.

trace.cpp contains the main() function and the uses the other classes.
